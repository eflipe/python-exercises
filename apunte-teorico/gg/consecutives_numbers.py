#Given K and a binary number, check if there exists k consecutive 1â€™s in the binary number.

# Python program to check if there
# is k consecutive 1's in a binary number

# fucntion to check if there are k
# consecutive 1's
def check(s,k):

    # form a new string of k 1's
    new = "1"*k

    # if there is k 1's at any position
    if new in s:
        print("yes")
    else:
        print("no")

# driver code
s = "101010011111"
k = 4
